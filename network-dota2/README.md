## The Best Player from all dota 2 professional tournaments 

This analysis is part of my internship project where the aim was to find who was the best player and the best team player.
With the data, with over more than a million samples, collected from <a href='opendota.com/'>OpenDota</a> we even found an correlation with the heroes pick and the win rate.
All the results was achieved by performing an dynamical network analysis.
